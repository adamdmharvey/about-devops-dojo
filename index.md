## What is the Online DevOps Dojo?

The <a href="{{ site.url }}/modules">Online DevOps Dojo</a> is a novel set of hands on training modules which cover both cultural and technical aspects of DevOps. 

The modules are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/dxc-technology/online-devops-dojo) and executed from the [Katacoda](https://www.katacoda.com/) platform. They can be run from your browser without any download or configuration.

Informed by research on how people learn, the DevOps Dojo curriculum incorporates storytelling
and emphasizes learning by doing to help improve learner engagement thus achieve desired learning outcomes.

As humans, we love stories we have been sharing them since time immemorial. The <a href="{{ site.url }}/modules">Online DevOps Dojo</a> takes an innovative, role-based story telling approach to enable hands-on training at scale. 

The <a href="{{ site.url }}/modules">Online DevOps Dojo</a> modules are set in the **Pet Clinic** multi-verse.

The modules place learners in real-world-like scenarios, scenarios where they work with a virtual cast of characters sharing the hopes and dreams of the **Pet Clinic** team as they learn about DevOps.

The troupe of characters in team **Pet Clinic** includes:

**P**aulo the **P**roduct Owner. A passionate and outcome-driven product owner with twenty years experience in all aspects of product delivery. He is particularly fond of using the word INCONCEIVABLE!, in response to which the team remind him that he keeps using that word and that it [doesn't mean what he thinks it means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D58LpHBnvsI).

**B**renda from the **B**usiness who is keen to take the Pet Clinic in to new growth areas sees DevOps being key to that. She is extremely proud of her two golden retrievers Bonnie and Clyde.

**H**al the white hat **H**acker, engaged by the company to find and expose vulnerabilities in the company's applications. Hal, tired of people asking him to open the pod bay doors, has been trying to get people to call him by the code name Neo instead. But most people still call him Hal. Hal has no pets due to a wide range of allergies.

**T**ina is a **T**ester. Tina is aware that the role of and skills required by a tester are changing.
Tina is keen to expand her strong testing skills, to become more technically adept, and learn more about coding so she can start working on test automation. Like Paulo she volunteers at the animal rescue center and helps run the Pet Clinic community engagement project that supports that shelter.
